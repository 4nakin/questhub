      Please don't.<br>
      Here's the short list of rules for possible quests:
      <ul>
        <li>all quests are good if they're related to Perl somehow;</li>
        <li>self-referential quests such as "get one more point" or "get to the top of players list" are not ok for obvious reasons;</li>
        <li>quests not relevant to Perl are temporarily discouraged, because I didn't figure out yet how to a) allow them; b) keep the game points meaningful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      On the other hand, don't hesitate to create a quest even if you feel like the task is too small and not worth a point. Anything that helps you to move forward is fine, and points=likes+1 rule ensures that everyone, in theory, will get a fair score in the end.
