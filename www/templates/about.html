    <h2>Concepts</h2>
    <h3>Opensource, gamified</h3>
    <p>
    Gamification is great for tuning people motivations in a positive way.<br>
    Play Perl gives you points and achievements to be proud of.
    </p>
  </div>

    <h3>Social Todo List</h3>
    <p>
    Play Perl allows you to announce your plans, gather the feedback, and find other people to cooperate with on common goals.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="row-fluid">
    <h3>Collaborative prioritization</h3>
    <p>
    By liking other people's quests, you promise them points, â€” or give them points right now if they already completed the quest.<br>
    So you can quickly gather opinions on what the community would like to be see more - new feature, internals refactoring, or new blog post.

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <dl>
      <dt>"Quest"? "Player"? What is this?</dt>
      <dd>Quest is any kind of task you're planning to do. Player is you, and other people are players too. You get 1+{number-of-likes} points for each quest you close.</dd>
      <dt>There are many other bug trackers! How is Play Perl different?</dt>
      <dd>
      Play Perl considers people to be more important than projects, and fun to be more important than planning. We're going to optimize its mechanics for:
      <ol>
        <li>People feeling appreciated;</li>
        <li>Praise being granted and received wherever and whenever necessary;</li>
        <li>Contribution simplified as much as possible.</li>
      </ol>
      There are many more ideas for future features, check out our <a href="https://github.com/berekuk/play-perl/wiki/DesignDraft">DesignDraft</a>.
      </dd>

      <dt>Is this for Perl 5 or for Perl 6?</dt>
      <dd>
      Both.<br>
      And also Moe, p2 and anything else that will grow out of Perl community in the future.
      </dd>

      <dt>Can I use this for my non-Perl tasks?</dt>
      <dd>
      Please don't.<br>
      Here's the short list of rules for possible quests:
      <ul>
        <li>all quests are good if they're related to Perl somehow;</li>
        <li>self-referential quests such as "get one more point" or "get to the top of players list" are not ok for obvious reasons;</li>
        <li>quests not relevant to Perl are temporarily discouraged, because I didn't figure out yet how to a) allow them; b) keep the game points meaningful.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      On the other hand, don't hesitate to create a quest even if you feel like the task is too small and not worth a point. Anything that helps you to move forward is fine, and points=likes+1 rule ensures that everyone, in theory, will get a fair score in the end.

      (tl;dr: play-github is going to happen one day.)
      </dd>

      <dt>This doesn't motivate me.</dt>
      <dd>That's ok. <a href="http://berekuk.github.com/perl-motivation-survey/">People are different.</a></dd>

      <dt>I can't use this without feature X.</dt>
      <dd>Why don't you <a href="https://github.com/berekuk/play-perl">implement it yourself?</a></dd>

      <dt>How can I add a link to a CPAN module in comments easily?</dt>
      <dd>If your module name contains <code>::</code>, it'll turn into the link to MetaCPAN automatically. Use <code>cpan:Foo</code> syntax for one-word module names.</dd>

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    Play Perl is built with:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://perldancer.org/">Dancer</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/">Backbone.js</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a></li>
      <li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Backend is completely separated from the frontend. Backend API is documented <a href="https://github.com/berekuk/play-perl/blob/master/app/API.md">here</a>, feel free to use it.<br>
    (But please don't abuse game mechanics or you'll be banned.)
    </p>

    Play Perl sources are open. <a href="https://github.com/berekuk/play-perl">Clone it on GitHub!</a>
