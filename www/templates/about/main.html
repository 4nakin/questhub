<h2>Concepts</h2>
<div>
  <h3>Social Todo List</h3>
  <p>
  You can announce your plans, gather the feedback, and find other people to cooperate with on common goals.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Tasks, gamified</h3>
  <p>
  Gamification is great for tuning motivations in a positive way.<br>
  Questhub gives you points and achievements for each task you complete.
  </p>
</div>
<div>
  <h3>Collaborative prioritization</h3>
  <p>
  By liking other people's quests, you promise them points, or give them points immediately if they already completed the quest.<br>
  So, people can quickly gather opinions on what the community would prefer you to do.

  <h2>FAQ</h2>
  <dl>
    <dt>"Quest"? "Player"? What is this?</dt>
    <dd>Quest is the any kind of task you're planning to do. Player is you, and other people are players too. You get 1+{number-of-likes} points for each quest you close.</dd>

    <dt>There are many other bug trackers and to-do lists! How is Questhub different?</dt>
    <dd>
    Questhub considers people to be more important than projects, and fun to be more important than planning. We're going to optimize its mechanics for:
    <ol>
      <li>People feeling appreciated;</li>
      <li>Praise being granted and received wherever and whenever necessary;</li>
      <li>Contribution simplified as much as possible.</li>
    </ol>
    There are many more ideas for future features, check out our <a href="https://github.com/berekuk/questhub/wiki/DesignDraft">DesignDraft</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is Perl realm for Perl 5 or for Perl 6?</dt>
    <dd>
    Both.<br>
    And also Moe, p2 and anything else that will grow out of Perl community in the future.
    </dd>

    <dt>Can I use this for my non-Perl tasks?</dt>
    <dd>
    Yes! Just add them in a different realm, or if you can't find one that fits, use <a href="/realm/chaos">Chaos</a> realm.
    </dd>

    <dt>This doesn't motivate me.</dt>
    <dd>That's ok. <a href="http://berekuk.github.com/perl-motivation-survey/">People are different.</a></dd>

    <dt>I can't use this without feature X.</dt>
    <dd>
    See our <a href="/about/feedback">Feedback</a> page.
    </dd>

    <dt>How can I add a link to a CPAN module in comments easily?</dt>
    <dd>
    If your Perl module name contains <code>::</code>, and you're on Perl realm, it'll turn into the link to MetaCPAN automatically. Use <code>cpan:Foo</code> syntax for one-word module names.
