# TODO

move "N points" circle to this top line 
add "move to another realm" button there somewhere (haven't figured out the right UI approach, any suggestions?) 
fix on mobile screens
decide if floating to the right is better than centering or moving to the left

check that realm info is already fetched when we hit quest-page

## Navigation

"go to realm X, tab Y"
Backbone.trigger "navigate:realm", { tab: ... }

# DONE

get rid of the last remaining "hidden" part of top menu 
maybe shade it in gray font
make circles clickable
stencil-page
